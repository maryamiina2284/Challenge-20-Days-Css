# 🎯 20 Days CSS Challenge

Welcome to the **20 Days CSS Challenge!**  
This repository contains 20 mini CSS projects built over 20 days to sharpen my CSS, HTML, and basic frontend design skills. Each project focuses on a specific layout, effect, or component — from buttons and forms to layouts and animations.

---

## 📚 Project Structure

Each day has its own folder named `ChallengeDay1` to `ChallengeDay20`. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- `index.html` – the main HTML file
- `style.css` – the CSS file
- (Optional) `script.js` – if needed for interaction
- Shared image(s) loaded from the central `images/` folder

---

## 🧠 Purpose of This Challenge

- Practice pure HTML & CSS (and some vanilla JavaScript)
- Build consistent habits by working on daily mini-projects
- Improve layout skills: Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design
- Explore transitions, animations, and effects
